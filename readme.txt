The .bas file is an ASCII source file that needs to be converted to PETSCI using PETCAT (comes with Vice emulator) in order for it to work with a C64. I've included it as this is easier to work with nowadays.  

It is also helpful to compile this code as it will run a lot quicker after compilation.
