- Some items require multiple words (e.g. "bus ticket")
- Track `mn` (money) value carefully before purchases
- Endings printed with score breakdown at end of game

==========================
NEGATIVE & EDGE CASE TESTING
==========================
- INSUFFICIENT FUNDS:
  - Try to buy every item in the game without enough money.
  - Verify "you don't have enough money" message appears.

- STATE CONSISTENCY:
  - After selling the sculpture, try to `look at bottle` and `look at key`.
  - After selling the toy, try to `sell toy` again.
  - After using the coffee/burger, check inventory and try to `use` them again.
  - Try to `take` an item you already have in your inventory.

- PARSER STRESS-TESTING:
  - Use commands with filler words: "go to the north", "look at the bed".
  - Use nonsensical but valid commands: "kill bed", "use north", "sell house".
  - Verify the game responds with appropriate "I can't do that" messages.
