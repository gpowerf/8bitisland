# Player Manual (Short)

## Premise

Your copy of **FREEZE64** didn’t arrive. Rumour says someone snatched it. Explore Bit Island, earn a few dollars, buy gear, and decide how this day ends. There are **multiple endings**—survive, triumph, or… welp.

## How to talk to the game

* **Basic shape:** `VERB NOUN`
  Examples: `look window`, `take wallet`, `open wallet`, `talk`, `buy coffee`
* **With tool:** `VERB NOUN WITH NOUN`
  Example: `use key with troll`
* **Movement:** `n s e w` or `north south east west`
  Exits are shown after each location.
* **Inventory:** `inv` or `inventory`
* **Synonyms you have:** `look`/`examine`, `take`/`get`
* **Other verbs:** `talk`, `use`, `open`, `close`, `buy`, `sell`, `knock`, `kill`, `quit`, `save`, `load`, `help`
* **Accepted fillers (you can type them or skip them):** the game ignores words like `the`, `at`, `to`, `my`, `please`, `of`, `on`.
  (`go north` works because `go` is ignored. `pile of rocks` matches `rocks`.)
* **Multi-word nouns that work:** `bus ticket`, `trading cards`, `video rental card`, `warrior chicken`, `convy mart`, etc.

> **Tip:** If the game says “what about it?”, try `look` on the room (`look`) first, then `look <thing>`.

## World basics

* **Money:** Dollars show in your inventory. Prices are posted at counters. If you’re short, you’ll be told.
* **Shops & counters:** `talk` first, then `buy <thing>` / `sell <thing>`.
* **Buses:** At a bus stop, walk `east` to board (you’ll need a `bus ticket`).
* **C64 time:** Back home you can `use c64`—maybe not before you get certain things.
* **Clothes matter sometimes.** Try `open closet`.

## Saving & loading

* `save` writes a file (`8bit.sav`) to device 8.
* `load` restores it and reprints your current room.

## Goals

Find **all the endings**. Recover your magazine, maybe score a new game, and try different solutions. Persistence can change outcomes; so can what you’re carrying (or eating).
